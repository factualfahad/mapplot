Description: mapplot pulls a rasterized image of a map and plots points on it. Since the image is rasterized, mapplot can plot much more points than mplleaflet without choking the memory.

This is how it is used:
import mapplot;
mapplot.mapPoints(lats,lngs,args_center=[42.373404, -71.118798]);

#lats: a list of all the latitudes of the points
#lngs: a list of all the latitudes of the points
#args_center: the center for the map
